There's nothing to rehearse, but our sources tell us this should be called a reheasal dinner nonetheless. We'll be feeding all of the out-of-town family in the historic Bywater District.  Be prepared for some local cuisine.

We're going to dress "a little nice", and you can wear whatever you want. But please wear something!
