> Enjoying the sites of the city before the wedding.

Not sure what to do? Try some of these ideas.

1. Escape Room
	* A friend of ours runs the best escape room in town. Solve puzzles in a New Orleans parlour. Can you get out in time for the wedding? <a href="https://escapemyroom.com/">Schedule Now</a>
1. Swamp tours
	* Book <a href="http://www.cajunencounters.com/">here</a> to reserve a tour that leaves out of New Orleans and see some real life alligators.
1. Walk through the French Quarter.
	* A beautiful and historic part of New Orleans. Either take a self or guided <a href="http://www.freetoursbyfoot.com/things-to-do-in-the-french-quarter/">tour</a> and see some beautful architecture.

Lunch suggestions (too many to count)
1. Dat Dog 
	* some hot dogs with local flair
1. St. Roch Market 
	* lots of options in one place!
