Join us for some post wedding brunch at the happy couple's home in the Marigny. We'll all eat some brunch and you can send them a very special farwell while they head off to their honeymoon later that afternoon.

As with any big holiday in New Orleans, there are some amazing parades in the French Quarter you might want to hit up before you leave town. I hear the hats are to die for.
