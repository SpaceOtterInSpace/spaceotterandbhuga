We live in the Marginy. This neighborhood has some of the best New Orleans has to offer from culture to architecture. We feel that AirBnb represents what living here is like, not to mention the fact that it's only a few miles from the wedding venue. Check out <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/New-Orleans--LA?page=1&allow_override%5B%5D=&ss_id=ly0dja7r&neighborhoods%5B%5D=Marigny%2FBywater&s_tag=TXEZr0Uv" target="_blank">nearby Airbnb's</a> to appreciate what we love most about this city while you join us for our special day.
