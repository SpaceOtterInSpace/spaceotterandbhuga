<p>We've been living together for a few years, and we're happy with our home. We consider ourselves quite lucky in life, have all the dishes and sheets we need, and the best gift you can offer is your face at the festivities.</p>

<p>For the incorrigably generous amongst you, though, we've set up a honeymoon registry. Rather than dishes, you can buy us a cocktail. It's what we've always wanted, really.</p>
